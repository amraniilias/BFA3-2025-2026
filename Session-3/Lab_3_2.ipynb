    "## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) <a id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Object‑Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of structuring programs around **objects**—bundles of *state* (data/attributes) and *behavior* (functions/methods) that act together. Instead of writing one long script that passes lots of variables around (procedural style), OOP lets you model the world in terms of **classes** (blueprints) and **instances** (concrete objects created from those blueprints).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters:\n",
    "- **Modularity & readability** – related data and functions live together inside a class.\n",
    "- **Reusability** – you can create many instances from the same class and extend behavior via inheritance or composition.\n",
    "- **Maintainability** – changes localize to the class that owns the behavior.\n",
    "- **Domain modeling** – classes map cleanly to real‑world concepts (e.g., `Rectangle`, `Account`, `Loan`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The four core OOP ideas you will see in this lab:\n",
    "- **Encapsulation** – keep an object’s internals (attributes) controlled behind methods/properties.\n",
    "- **Abstraction** – expose only what users of your class need; hide unnecessary details.\n",
    "- **Inheritance** – define a new class by specializing an existing one.\n",
    "- **Polymorphism** – code that works with a *general* interface (e.g., a `.fly()` method) can accept many different concrete types.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python is a *dynamic, duck‑typed* language: you rarely declare types in the class body, and if two objects provide the methods you need, they’re interchangeable. Python also supports multiple inheritance (with care), and provides rich **special (“dunder”) methods** so your classes behave like built‑ins (e.g., support `+`, comparisons, iteration).\n",

    "A **class** defines the *shape* of future objects: which attributes they have and which methods operate on them. An **instance** (object) is created by *calling* the class like a function (e.g., `Rectangle(3, 4)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key terms:\n",
    "- **Attributes** – data stored on the instance (e.g., `self.width`).\n",
    "- **Instance** – a specific object created from a class (e.g., `rect1`).\n",
    "- **Constructor** – the `__init__` method that runs immediately after the instance is created.\n",
    "- **Method** – a function defined inside a class; it automatically receives the instance as the first parameter, traditionally named `self`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linked code snippet (procedural vs OOP – `Rectangle`):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Procedural\n",
    "def area_rectangle(width, height):\n",
    "    return width * height\n",

    "# OOP\n",

    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- The procedural version requires you to pass `width` and `height` *every time*.\n",
    "- The OOP version **binds state to behavior**. After `rect = Rectangle(3, 4)`, the data lives *inside* `rect`, and `rect.area()` uses that state.\n",
    "- `__init__` assigns attributes on `self` so each instance can carry its own values.\n",
    "- If you later add `perimeter()` or `scale(factor)`, all behaviors remain grouped inside `Rectangle`—clean and maintainable.\n"

    "## Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Object-Oriented Programming, attributes are variables that belong to a class or an object and store its state or properties. Each instance attribute is tied to a specific object and can hold values unique to that instance (e.g., a Car object’s make and model). Class attributes, on the other hand, are shared across all instances of a class (e.g., wheels = 4 for all cars by default). Attributes are usually defined inside the __init__ method for instances, or directly in the class body for class-wide defaults. Together with methods, attributes define what an object “knows” and how it behaves."

    "## Methods, `self`, and method types <a id=\"C2\"></a>\n",
    "In Object-Oriented Programming, methods are functions defined inside a class that describe the behaviors or actions an object can perform. Unlike regular functions, methods automatically take the object itself as their first parameter (conventionally named self), which allows them to access and modify the object’s attributes. Methods can be of different types: instance methods (operate on a specific object), class methods (operate on the class as a whole, using cls), and static methods (utility functions that belong to the class but don’t need access to self or cls). In short, methods define what an object can do and how it interacts with its own data or with other objects.\n",

Instead of letting external code freely change an object’s variables, encapsulation enforces controlled access through well-defined interfaces (like getters, setters, or properties). This protects the integrity of the data, prevents unintended side effects, and makes the class easier to maintain or update without breaking external code.\n",

    "#### Definition:\n",
    "Inheritance is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) mechanism that allows a new class (called a child class or subclass) to acquire the attributes and methods of an existing class (called a parent class or base class). This lets us reuse code and establish a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "Instead of duplicating code across multiple related classes, inheritance enables you to define common behavior in a base class and then extend or specialize it in subclasses. This reduces repetition, makes your code more organized, and reflects real-world hierarchies. However, inheritance should only be used when the relationship is truly is-a (e.g., a Dog is an Animal). If the relationship is has-a (e.g., a Car has an Engine), then composition is more appropriate."

    "\n",
    "#### Definition:\n",
    "Polymorphism in OOP means that the same operation or method name can be applied to different types of objects, and each object responds in its own way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "Instead of writing separate functions for each type, you write one general piece of code that works for many objects. Polymorphism is the backbone of flexibility in OOP: it allows you to treat different classes through a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, polymorphism happens in two main ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding (inheritance-based polymorphism): subclasses override a base method to provide specific behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Duck typing (structural polymorphism): Python doesn’t care about the type of the object, only that it has the required method or behavior."

    "#### Definition:\n",
    "Composition is the principle of building classes by combining smaller, reusable components (objects of other classes) rather than inheriting from a parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "Whereas inheritance answers “is-a” (a Dog is an Animal), composition answers “has-a” (a Car has an Engine). This approach is more flexible, because you can swap components without changing the containing class. Composition encourages modularity, code reuse, and avoids the rigid hierarchies that come with deep inheritance chains."
